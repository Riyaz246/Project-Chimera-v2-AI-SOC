# 🛡️ Project Chimera: AI-Powered Self-Healing SOC
### Automated Ransomware Containment & Forensics Pipeline

**Role:** Security Engineer | **Stack:** Wazuh, Sysmon, Python, Llama 3 (Ollama)

## 📌 Executive Summary
Designed and engineered a fully automated "Self-Healing" SOC pipeline. The system detects ransomware behavior (file encryption) in real-time, instantly triggers a "Kill Switch" to terminate the threat (Active Response), and engages a local LLM (Llama 3) to perform instant forensic triage and generate a CISO-ready incident report.

**Key Metrics:**
* **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR):** <1 Second (Automated Containment).
* **Infrastructure:** 100% On-Premise/Local (Zero Cloud Cost).
* **Tech Integrated:** SIEM, Endpoint Telemetry, SOAR, and Generative AI.

## 📸 Technical Pipeline Walkthrough

### Phase 1: Detection Engineering (The Trap)
Instead of relying on fragile file hashes, I engineered a behavioral detection rule in XML. This rule monitors Sysmon Event ID 11 (File Creation) for rapid encryption anomalies (e.g., `.locked` extensions) and maps them to **MITRE ATT&CK T1486**.

### Phase 2: The Attack & Automated Response (SOAR)
I developed a Python script to simulate a live ransomware attack. As seen below, the moment the script attempts to encrypt files, Wazuh detects the anomaly and triggers an **Active Response** script (`kill_ransomware.cmd`) that terminates the process ID immediately.

### Phase 3: AI-Powered Analysis (The Forensics)
Once the threat is contained, a custom Python listener forwards the alert metadata to a local **Llama 3** model (via Ollama). The AI acts as a Level 3 Analyst, generating a hypothesis, forensic recommendations, and an executive summary.
